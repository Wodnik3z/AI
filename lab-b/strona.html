        <h1>The racing city</h1>
        <p>Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport, attracting millions of fans around the world. It is a sport that combines speed, skill, strategy, technology, and glamour. But how did it start and why is it so popular? Formula 1 has its roots in the European Grand Prix championships of the 1920s and 1930s, which featured races between powerful and elegant cars from different countries. However, the modern Formula 1 began in 1950, when the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) established a World Championship of Drivers, based on a set of rules that defined the specifications of the cars and the format of the races1.
            The thrill of competition: Formula 1 is a sport where the smallest margins can make the biggest difference. The drivers have to push themselves and their machines to the limit, while the teams have to devise the best strategies and tactics to gain an edge over their rivals. The races are often unpredictable and exciting, with overtaking, crashes, pit stops, and weather changes adding to the drama.
            The diversity of the sport: Formula 1 is a sport that appeals to a wide range of audiences, as it showcases different aspects of human endeavour. The drivers are the stars of the show, displaying their courage, talent, and personality. The teams are the brains behind the operation, demonstrating their creativity, innovation, and teamwork. The circuits are the stages of the spectacle, reflecting the culture, history, and geography of the countries that host them.
